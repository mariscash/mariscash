My name is Marissa, and I am a 4th-year undergraduate electrical engineering student at the University of Virginia. I am currently learning GitHub for its use in ECE 6380: AI Hardware. I am interested in learning more about GitHub use within the classroom.

Some things about me:

- Currently working on capstone project involving radio communication between bikes at various altitudes
- Favorite hobbies include shopping, running, spending time with friends, and petting cats
